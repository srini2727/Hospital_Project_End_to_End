Subject: Enterprise Healthcare Data Platform Portfolio Project

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I wanted to share a production-ready data engineering project I built:
Hospital Analytics — a multi-source healthcare data platform.

Key Highlights:
✓ Consolidates 3 hospital systems with inconsistent schemas
✓ Demonstrates enterprise data engineering patterns
✓ Includes multi-source reconciliation, data quality, observability
✓ Production-grade: dbt, Snowflake, Mage.ai, Power BI

Start here: [GitHub Link]
Quick summary: HIRING_MANAGER_BRIEF.md (2 min read)
Full details: README.md

This shows I can design and implement production data platforms
from day one.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Hospital Analytics

A production-ready end-to-end healthcare data platform that consolidates 
3 hospital systems with inconsistent schemas into a unified analytics warehouse.

🔑 Key Patterns Demonstrated:
✅ Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
✅ Multi-source reconciliation (TRY_TO_DECIMAL() detection)
✅ Data quality at scale (12+ rules, quarantine zones)
✅ Observability (OPS monitoring, audit trails)
✅ Scalability design (3 hospitals → 30+)

Tech stack: Mage.ai + dbt + Snowflake + Power BI

GitHub: [Link]

This is the kind of enterprise data engineering Fortune 500 companies 
need. Open to feedback!

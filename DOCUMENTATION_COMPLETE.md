## 💬 What To Say

### When Sharing with Recruiters
> "I've built an enterprise healthcare data platform that consolidates three hospital systems with inconsistent schemas into a unified warehouse. It demonstrates production data engineering patterns: medallion architecture, multi-source reconciliation, data quality at scale, observability, and scalability. Ready to discuss."

### When Presenting to Hiring Managers
> "Let me show you how I solved a complex real-world problem: three hospitals with inconsistent data schemas. I built a platform to reconcile the data, guarantee quality, and provide sub-second analytics queries. This is the kind of work Fortune 500 companies need."

### When Interviewing Technically
> "The key challenge was multi-source reconciliation. Hospitals had the same conceptual schema but misaligned columns due to legacy ETL bugs. I solved it with SQL conditional logic using TRY_TO_DECIMAL() to detect broken rows and reconstruct them. No data loss, complete audit trail."
